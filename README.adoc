= SIQ Cadastre Model

***NOTE: This repository is for a project that is at an early stage of development so much of the content for this model does not exist yet. March, 2023***

This model is online at **https://linked.data.gov.au/def/cad**

This repository contains a data model for Cadastral information in Queensland. It is a system-independent model created using the https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/[Web Ontology Language (OWL)] that may be realised in any system that can meet its modelled elements.

This model is both a stand-alone model for cadastral information and also a _Component Model_ part of an integrative multi-model regime known as a _Supermodel_. The SIQ Supermodel aims to integrate cadastre, address, place name and other information. For more information about the SIQ Supermodel, see the https://github.com/Spatial-Information-QLD/supermodel[Supermodel's temporary home]
