== Preamble

=== Abstract

A Semantic Web data model of cadastre information. It caters specifically for Queensland's data management needs.

[NOTE]
This model was made for Queensland Spatial Information, a unit of the Queensland Department of Resources, to assist with their future address and roads database design. It is a Component Model of their 'QSI Supermodel' which includes models for Address, Geographical Names and Cadastral information which are all designed to work together, however they may all be used independently too.

=== Namespaces

This model is built on a small set of well-regarded Semantic Web models which use a variety of namespaces. Prefixes for this namespaces, used throughout this document, are listed below.
